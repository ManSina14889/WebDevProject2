### API Endpoints
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/rooms/*` - Room management
- `/api/customers/*` - Customer management

### Data Models
`Rooms: Manage karaoke rooms`
- Manage karaoke rooms Key fields: id, roomNumber, capacity, status ('available' | 'maintenance')
- CRUD: Create room, list/get rooms, update room (number/capacity/status), delete room
    
`Users(customer/admin)`
- Key fields: id, name, email, phone, role ('user' | 'admin'), password (hashed)
- CRUD: Register/create user, list/get users, update profile, delete account

`Bookings: Manage room reservations`
- Key fields: id, roomId, customerId, date, startTime, endTime, status ('booked' | 'completed' | 'cancelled')
- CRUD: Create booking, list/get bookings (with filters), update status/times, delete booking

- we did say our Data Models were gonna be User/Admins/Booking before however user and admin kinda fall under the same category
- If ajarn is okay with the previous Data Models then we go with that but if not then we can use the given Data Model :) :)
